## My process

### Built with

- HTML:
  - Sematic HTML Markup
- CSS:
  - Flexbox
  - Media Queries
- Accesibility Testing (NVDA)
- Mobile development

### What I learned

- To table border styling work, use `table td`.
- You can use: `line-height: 1.5;`
- `1em` means one line


### Continued development
- Use of less margins and relying more on flexbox

### Useful resources
